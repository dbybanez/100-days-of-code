# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 5, 2020
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Done setting up the MongoDB and the MySQL server for my Javascript project.

**Thoughts:** This is my first time using MongoDB since I'm required to have a comparisson on three different databases The third database I'm going to setup is SQL Server (MSSQL).

### Day 2: August 6, 2020 
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Done setting up MSSQL, the third database I'm going to use for the project.

**Thoughts**: Setting up MSSQL was a bit challenging compared to MySQL and MongoDB. I had to configure a lot of settings in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and in services.msc. I also had to create another type of use since my default user for SQL Server is my PC account.

### Day 3: August 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Done setting up the back-end of my fill-stack javascript web application which uses Express (Node). I'm only using MongoDB in the meantime to speed up the setup stage. New link for the project below.

**Thoughts:** I'm actually following a tutorial on Youtube from Brad (Traversy), highly recommended. But I'd also suggest to read the comments since the tutorial was posted years ago and there has been slight changes on how to setup the environment.
