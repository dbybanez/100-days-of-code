**Today's Progress**: Done setting up the MongoDB and the MySQL server for my Javascript project.

**Thoughts:** This is my first time using MongoDB since I'm required to have a comparisson on three different databases The third database I'm going to setup is SQL Server (MSSQL).

### Day 2: August 6, 2020 
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Done setting up MSSQL, the third database I'm going to use for the project.

**Thoughts**: Setting up MSSQL was a bit challenging compared to MySQL and MongoDB. I had to configure a lot of settings in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and in services.msc. I also had to create another type of use since my default user for SQL Server is my PC account.
