# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 5, 2020
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Done setting up the MongoDB and the MySQL server for my Javascript project.

**Thoughts:** This is my first time using MongoDB since I'm required to have a comparisson on three different databases The third database I'm going to setup is SQL Server (MSSQL).

### Day 2: August 6, 2020 
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Done setting up MSSQL, the third database I'm going to use for the project.

**Thoughts**: Setting up MSSQL was a bit challenging compared to MySQL and MongoDB. I had to configure a lot of settings in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and in services.msc. I also had to create another type of use since my default user for SQL Server is my PC account.

### Day 3: August 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Done setting up the back-end of my fill-stack javascript web application which uses Express (Node). I'm only using MongoDB in the meantime to speed up the setup stage. New link for the project below.

**Thoughts:** I'm actually following a tutorial on Youtube from Brad Traversy (Traversy Media), highly recommended. But I'd also suggest to read the comments since the tutorial was posted years ago and there has been slight changes on how to setup the environment.

### Day 4: August 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Done setting up the front-end of my full-stack javascript web application. Vue is awesome! 

**Thoughts:** Got few minor bumps along the way though. I had to update Node because it's causing Vue errors. But after updating it, I was able to run Vue. After setting up the back-end and the front-end, I now have a full-stack javascript web application!

### Day 5: August 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Integrated MySQL to the current setup (MySQL + MEVN stack).

**Thoughts:** Async, Await and Promises... I'm still confused on how these things work ðŸ¤£ but I was able to integrate the MySQL database anyways haha. One integration more to go and I should be done on the MMMEVN stack setup.

### Day 6: August 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Setup new development machine

**Thoughts:** I'm setting up another development machine because I'm experiencing problems with my local SQL Server. I'll be using a different machine for MSSQL integration. Ugh.

### Day 7: August 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Fixed an error when running vue in my local machine. Opened millions of Google Chrome tabs just to find out I just need to remove one line of code. ðŸ˜‘

**Thoughts:** I need to read documentations and not straight out writing stuff. Like really. Also, I'm finally back after several days of not coding. I couldn't work on my project because of power outages in my area.

### Day 8: August 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Integrated MSSQL in my MEVN stack. Now I got a full MMMEVN stack (MSSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Express, Vue, and Node). Ez Pz Lemon Squeezy. A big shoutout to my mentor, Stack Overflow, and to the best university in the world, YouTube University. ðŸ˜†

**Thoughts:** It all worked fine. I guess. I'll now work on the front-end.

### Day 9: August 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Setting up the UI of my project. Before diving into it, I'm gonna do some wireframes in the next couple of days.

**Thoughts:** How do you measure CPU usage of a database?
