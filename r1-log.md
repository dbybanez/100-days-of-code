# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Your Name Here]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [August 5, Wednesday, 2020].

## Log

### R1D1 
Started a full-stack Javascript web application using MEVN stack but modified so it would now be MMMEVN lol. This project is one of the requirements for my Master's Degree in IT. https://github.com/dbybanez/database-comparison

### R1D2
Finally done setting up MMSQL (SQL Server) for my project. The overall experience was quite challenging for me since I never use SQL Server in my projects. Although I've tried using it for our Data Warehouse class, we never actually tried using it in any web applications. https://github.com/dbybanez/database-comparison

### R1D3
Done setting up the back-end of my full-stack Javascript web application Express (Node) for the local server, MongoDB for the test database, Postman for testing the API. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D4
Front-end done! Vue is awesome. But I had few minor bumps when setting it up. I had to update Node so I could run Vue. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D5
Integrated MySQL to the current setup (MySQL + MEVN stack). One more database integration to go and I should be done with the MMMEVN stack. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D6
I'm setting up another development machine because I'm experiencing problems with my local SQL Server. I'll be using a different machine for MSSQL integration. Ugh. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D7
Fixed an error when running vue in my local machine. Opened millions of Google Chrome tabs just to find out I just need to remove one line of code. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D8
Integrated MSSQL in my MEVN stack. Now I got a full MMMEVN stack (MSSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Express, Vue, and Node). Ez Pz Lemon Squeezy. A big shoutout to my mentor, Stack Overflow, and to the best university in the world, YouTube University. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D9
Setting up the UI of my project. Before diving into it, I'm gonna do some wireframes in the next couple of days. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D10
Trying to figure out how to integrate SCSS files to my vue app. Just like how Gulp works. Vue is difficult. Lol. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D11
Started to play around the views and layouts for Vue. I'll probably test out Nuxt.js next and utilize webpack instead of Gulp. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D12
Working on the UI of my project. I'll stick with my current setup but I'll definitely explore Nuxt after this. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D13
Decided to learn Nuxt and use it for my project. Successfully integrated everything. Express, MySQL, MongoDB, MSSQL, and Bootstrap (UI). I've encountered a lot of error but managed to fix them one by one.  https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D14
Working on the UI. Trying to understand more on how components, layouts, and pages work in Nuxt. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D15
Refactoring database connections. Currently struggling on how to check database connection for MySQL Node. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D16
Backend work. Still working on the problem... day 2 lol https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D17
MySQL error handling finally working. Now with MSSQL. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D18
Refactored database connection which returns a status when the DB server cannot be reached. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D19
Working on the Run Test function. How do you pass values from one sibling component to another sibling component? https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D20
Still working on the Run Test function. Can't figure out how to pass a data from one component to another after after receiving a data from another component. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D21
Learning Vuex. Forums, Google search results, Reddit, and Stack Overflow suggest that I should use Vuex for this problem. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D22
Completed a crash course on Vuex. If you're into web development or if you're new to it, I highly recommend Brad (Travery Media). He explains everything very well. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D23
Integrated Vuex to my project. Done setting up modules for the store, and migrated test run functions to Vuex. Vuex makes everything easier. Special thanks to the Stack Overflow and Reddit community for helping me out. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D24
Created a page to display the results from the run test function. I'll finish this up and work on the backend again in the next day. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D25
Taking a break from my school project. I'm building my new portfolio site with more contents using NuxtJS. https://github.com/dbybanez/portfolio

### R1D26
Working on the backend again. Promises, promise all, ugh. https://github.com/dbybanez/portfolio

### R1D27
All 3 API endpoint now works. Each endpoint gets all data from MySQL, MSSQL, and MongoDB. Encountered an error when trying to do a load test on the MySQL API endpoint. It throws a "packets out of order" error when doing concurrency of 10 within 20 seconds. But it was an easy fix. Just a couple of Google tabs. 😆 https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D28
Endpoint for load test done. Added system info. I'm almost done with my project, just a few things to work on the front-end. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D29
Added static charts using Vue-chartjs to visualize the data passed from the endpoints. This might be challenging when using the actual data. But I don't really know. Haha https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D30
rps = total number of requests / time. I've been studying lol.  https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D31
Fully integrated chartjs and implemented a store for system information. Took me a month to finish my project using technologies I've never used before. And it's finally working! 🎉  https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D32
Since I'm done with my project, I'm planning to start a new one. I'm thinking about using Java for this project just to give myself a refresher -- I haven't used Java since college. Lol  https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D33
Java aint for me.

### R1D34
Trying to figure out how to fix JNI error in Java. But I think I'm pretty close to solving it. I just need some admin rights. Damnit.

### R1D35
Fixed JNI error. IDE setup done. Was able to fix the error, I had to remove all Java and then download the JDK zip so I can switch between versions. Started learning the basics.

### R1D36
Our final project would be to create a facial detection app using Java and to come up with a use case for it. To start, I created a simple app that opens the camera of my laptop.

### R1D37
Working on my portfolio website and I find it consfusing when setting up the SSL. 

### R1D38
I feel like I've messed everything up. I'll have to wait again to see if my website really works.

### R1D39
After days of scratching my head, my site finally shows up! :)

### R1D40
Done setting up my website's SEO but I'll do minor changes tomorrow. Need to read a case study for my class tomorrow. 😓

### R1D41
Integrated FB Messenger Platform and added sitemap for Google Search Console. 

### R1D42
Disabled Guest Mode in FB Messenger to avoid trolls. 😬

### R1D43
Updated website footer. I'll have to sign off early today because I'm having problems with my connection. Once this gets fixed, I'll finish my facial recognition project. 

### R1D44
Getting back to my unfinished Java crash course. 

### R1D45
Arrays, Multi-dimensional arrays, constants, arithmetic expressions, order of operations, casting, Math class, and formatting numbers. 

### R1D46
Bug fix on my portfolio site. Had to quickly fix a bug I saw on my portfolio site. The FB Messenger keeps on blinking non-stop. 

### R1D47
Java week: Comparison operators, logical operators, if statements, simplying if statements, ternary operator, switch statements.

### R1D48
Java week: Object-oriented programming session.

### R1D49 & 50
Java session: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Encapsulation. Took a day-off yesterday from coding to recharge my body. Went to the beach to relax, enjoy the weather, and listen to the sound of the waves. 🌊

### R1D51
New project! I'm not done with Java but I can't wait to build another project. I'm working on a mini project which I'll share in the next couple of days.

### R1D52
New mini project is a URL shortener. I'll be using Nuxt, Express, MySQL stack for this project. 

### R1D53
Created endpoint to retrieve all URLs generated. I'll work on creating a URL but I forgot how to post a data. 😐

### R1D54
Implemented create URL. Woooh!

### R1D55
I just hate form validation. But at least I'm done with it. 

### R1D56
Working on a function that will update the number of clicks of a given link. Will continue tomorrow because my migraine is killing me. 

### R1D57
URL redirect now works. But I haven't tested it in a real server. 

### R1D58
URL redirect isn't working again. The app looks pretty bad and I think I kinda messed everything up. I'm thinking of abandoning it and start all over again. I should've planned the architecture before jumping to coding. 😑

### R1D59
URL shortener V2. Decided to start all over again. But this time, with clean code. 🐱‍👤

### R1D60
URL shortener V2. Started with the UI using Nuxt. 

### R1D61
Added my SCSS boilerplate into the project. So far so good. LOL

### R1D62
Created home page layout. Wasn't able to code much today, my besfwen just got married and he made me a driver for a day. But still, congrats!! 🎉 

### R1D63
Created component for default form. One of the things that made me decide to redo the mini-project is that I didn't have a clean code. I was so focused on building the app without thinking about the maintainability of the project. 

### R1D64
Added URL input validation. Error occurs when the field is empty or the input is invalid input. 

### R1D65
Added Slug input validation. The app lets users use their own slug for their URL. I had to search for regex where it filters special charaters. I was thinking of accepting underscores and hyphens but it makes the regex more complicated. 

### R1D66
Moved methods and other data to the store. Decided to use vuex for the project so it would be easier to maintain later. 

### R1D67
Created a component which shows the generated URL. Next task: work on a feature where users can edit or delete their URL. 

### R1D68
Figuring out how to open a modal in Vue. Man, this is confusing.

### R1D69
Modal works but it doesn't have any animation. And I can't dismiss the modal by clicking outside the box. I'll explore more about it later. In the meantime, I'll continue working on the backend. 

### R1D70
Learning OOP in Java. Taking a break from my mini project. I should really start working on my school project, which is to make a face detection app. 

### R1D71
Short exercise in Java: Multidimentional arrays.

### R1D72
Laravel crash. I'm kinda mixing a lot of stuff lately. I had this new project at work where the dev team decided to use Laravel + Vue.JS tech stack. I used PHP several years ago but after learning JS backend, I just kinda got off with it. 

### R1D73
Familiarizing Laravel structure. Any good tutorials for Laravel 8?

### R1D74-76
Classes, constructors, and overloading in Java. Haven't posted for the past few days, I've been busy studying for my midterm exams (OOP and Project Management). 

### R1D77-83
Done with my exams. I should be back on track starting tomorrow. I'm starting to like Java now. 

### R1D84
Resuming my Laravel learning sessions. I'm trying to figure out how to use Nuxt in Laravel. It would be easier for me to understand if there's a data flow diagram available but I guess I'll have to figure it out myself. 

### R1D85
Basic routing and controllers with Laravel. Following another good tutorial from Brad.

### R1D86
Fetching data with Eloquent. Wow, never thought Laravel was this easy. I'm starting to like PHP again. Very cool, Laravel.

### R1D87
Forms, saving, edit, and delete data. Once I'm done with Laravel, I'll get back to my mini project and finish it before the challenge ends. 

### R1D88
Added user authentication. Laravel just makes everything easier. Wow.

### R1D89
Model relationships and file uploads. Done with the Laravel series. I'm gonna get back with my mini project to finish the 100 days of code challenge.

### R1D90
Finishing my mini project.
