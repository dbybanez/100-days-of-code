## Log

### R1D1 
Started a full-stack Javascript web application using MEVN stack but modified so it would now be MMMEVN lol. This project is one of the requirements for my Master's Degree in IT. https://github.com/dbybanez/database-comparison

### R1D2
Finally done setting up MMSQL (SQL Server) for my project. The overall experience was quite challenging for me since I never use SQL Server in my projects. Although I've tried using it for our Data Warehouse class, we never actually tried using it in any web applications. https://github.com/dbybanez/database-comparison
