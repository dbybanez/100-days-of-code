# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Your Name Here]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [August 5, Wednesday, 2020].

## Log

### R1D1 
Started a full-stack Javascript web application using MEVN stack but modified so it would now be MMMEVN lol. This project is one of the requirements for my Master's Degree in IT. https://github.com/dbybanez/database-comparison

### R1D2
Finally done setting up MMSQL (SQL Server) for my project. The overall experience was quite challenging for me since I never use SQL Server in my projects. Although I've tried using it for our Data Warehouse class, we never actually tried using it in any web applications. https://github.com/dbybanez/database-comparison

### R1D3
Done setting up the back-end of my full-stack Javascript web application Express (Node) for the local server, MongoDB for the test database, Postman for testing the API. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D4
Front-end done! Vue is awesome. But I had few minor bumps when setting it up. I had to update Node so I could run Vue. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D5
Integrated MySQL to the current setup (MySQL + MEVN stack). One more database integration to go and I should be done with the MMMEVN stack. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D6
I'm setting up another development machine because I'm experiencing problems with my local SQL Server. I'll be using a different machine for MSSQL integration. Ugh. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D7
Fixed an error when running vue in my local machine. Opened millions of Google Chrome tabs just to find out I just need to remove one line of code. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D8
Integrated MSSQL in my MEVN stack. Now I got a full MMMEVN stack (MSSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Express, Vue, and Node). Ez Pz Lemon Squeezy. A big shoutout to my mentor, Stack Overflow, and to the best university in the world, YouTube University. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D9
Setting up the UI of my project. Before diving into it, I'm gonna do some wireframes in the next couple of days. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D10
Trying to figure out how to integrate SCSS files to my vue app. Just like how Gulp works. Vue is difficult. Lol. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D11
Started to play around the views and layouts for Vue. I'll probably test out Nuxt.js next and utilize webpack instead of Gulp. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D12
Working on the UI of my project. I'll stick with my current setup but I'll definitely explore Nuxt after this. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D13
Decided to learn Nuxt and use it for my project. Successfully integrated everything. Express, MySQL, MongoDB, MSSQL, and Bootstrap (UI). I've encountered a lot of error but managed to fix them one by one.  https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D14
Working on the UI. Trying to understand more on how components, layouts, and pages work in Nuxt. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D15
Refactoring database connections. Currently struggling on how to check database connection for MySQL Node. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D16
Backend work. Still working on the problem... day 2 lol https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D17
MySQL error handling finally working. Now with MSSQL. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D18
Refactored database connection which returns a status when the DB server cannot be reached. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D19
Working on the Run Test function. How do you pass values from one sibling component to another sibling component? https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D20
Still working on the Run Test function. Can't figure out how to pass a data from one component to another after after receiving a data from another component. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D21
Learning Vuex. Forums, Google search results, Reddit, and Stack Overflow suggest that I should use Vuex for this problem. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D22
Completed a crash course on Vuex. If you're into web development or if you're new to it, I highly recommend Brad (Travery Media). He explains everything very well. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D23
Integrated Vuex to my project. Done setting up modules for the store, and migrated test run functions to Vuex. Vuex makes everything easier. Special thanks to the Stack Overflow and Reddit community for helping me out. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D24
Created a page to display the results from the run test function. I'll finish this up and work on the backend again in the next day. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D25
Taking a break from my school project. I'm building my new portfolio site with more contents using NuxtJS. https://github.com/dbybanez/portfolio

### R1D26
Working on the backend again. Promises, promise all, ugh. https://github.com/dbybanez/portfolio

### R1D27
All 3 API endpoint now works. Each endpoint gets all data from MySQL, MSSQL, and MongoDB. Encountered an error when trying to do a load test on the MySQL API endpoint. It throws a "packets out of order" error when doing concurrency of 10 within 20 seconds. But it was an easy fix. Just a couple of Google tabs. 😆 https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D28
Endpoint for load test done. Added system info. I'm almost done with my project, just a few things to work on the front-end. https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D29
Added static charts using Vue-chartjs to visualize the data passed from the endpoints. This might be challenging when using the actual data. But I don't really know. Haha https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D30
rps = total number of requests / time. I've been studying lol.  https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D31
Fully integrated chartjs and implemented a store for system information. Took me a month to finish my project using technologies I've never used before. And it's finally working! 🎉  https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D32
Since I'm done with my project, I'm planning to start a new one. I'm thinking about using Java for this project just to give myself a refresher -- I haven't used Java since college. Lol  https://github.com/dbybanez/dbs-webapp

### R1D33
Java aint for me.

### R1D34
Trying to figure out how to fix JNI error in Java. But I think I'm pretty close to solving it. I just need some admin rights. Damnit.

### R1D35
Fixed JNI error. IDE setup done. Was able to fix the error, I had to remove all Java and then download the JDK zip so I can switch between versions. Started learning the basics.

### R1D36
Our final project would be to create a facial detection app using Java and to come up with a use case for it. To start, I created a simple app that opens the camera of my laptop.

### R1D37
Working on my portfolio website and I find it consfusing when setting up the SSL. 

### R1D38
I feel like I've messed everything up. I'll have to wait again to see if my website really works.

### R1D39
After days of scratching my head, my site finally shows up! :)

### R1D40
Done setting up my website's SEO but I'll do minor changes tomorrow. Need to read a case study for my class tomorrow. 😓
